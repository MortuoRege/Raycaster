**Raycaster Engine**

A simple raycasting engine built from scratch using C++ and SDL2, inspired by the rendering techniques of early 3D games like Wolfenstein 3D. This project is designed to help understand the fundamentals of real-time 3D rendering and grid-based world navigation.

**Main principle**
the engine uses DDA algorithm for casting rays,if we imagiine the world as a grid with 1x menaing instead of incrementing the ray with tiny increments it jumps from one "box" to another
